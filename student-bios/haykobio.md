## **About myself.**

I am Hayk right now i am 18 years old. I was born in Armenia i lived there for 7 years then i moved to Belgium. I love programming specially web development. I got interested in programming when i was 15. I started with ***python*** but i kinda gave up on it, after that is wanted to ba a game developer so started with unity and tried to learn **C#** but it was to hard for me. After that i started with another game engine called **GDevelop** but i realized it was to time consuming for 1developer to make a game so i decided to do sometging else and started photoshoping and video editing. I still do it but only if necessary. Then i saw ***HTML and CSS*** so i started learning webdevelopment front end to be exact. Becouse of school i couldn't learn much and i forgot the most things that i learnd, i took big pauses in my programming journey but now i am ready to recontinue my jouney and hopefully nothing can stop me.
