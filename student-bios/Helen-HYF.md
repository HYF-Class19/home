## About Helen⚡

### sci-fi movie fanatic?💻

> In this self-introduction, I'm going to discuss Sci-fi films that
> revolutionized my thought process. Often Sci-fi films play off the real
> against the artificial, either in the form of humans versus non-human
> (androids, cyborgs, synthetics), or the world versus the non-world
> (cyberspace, inner-space, intentional space). The science fiction genre
> establishes conventions that distinguish it from other genre films, by
> creating thought-provoking content that appeals to a wide audience. It creates
> a world altered by time and technology, and these movies I have listed were
> the best ones for me Rick and Morty,The Matrix, and Black Mirror.
