## My motivation?

Since my arrival in Belgium, I couldn;t help but notice how easier it was find
**_information and government services_** online as compared to back home.
Therefore, in the long-run, I hope to contribute in providing Kenyans with
**_access_** to crucial **_information and services_** through **_user-friendly
websites and Web-Apps_**. The road ahead might be difficult, but as it is
commonly said;
