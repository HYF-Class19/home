webdevelopment._

## **About Myself.**

I am Hayk right now i am 18 years old. I was born in Armenia i lived there for 7
years then i moved to Belgium. I love programming specially web development. I
got interested in programming when i was 15. I started with **_python_** but i
kinda gave up on it, after that is wanted to ba a game developer so started with
unity and tried to learn **C#** but it was to hard for me. After that i started
with another game engine called **GDevelop** but i realized it was to time
consuming for 1developer to make a game so i decided to do sometging else and
started photoshoping and video editing. I still do it but only if necessary.
Then i saw **_HTML and CSS_** so i started learning webdevelopment front end to
be exact. Becouse of school i couldn't learn much and i forgot the most things
that i learnd, i took big pauses in my programming journey but now i am ready to
recontinue my jouney and hopefully nothing can stop me.
